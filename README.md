Reg plugin
Chrome Extension used by the Registration Department to assist with checking in attendees.

The extension scrapes data from Neon (our Registration system) and compares it to provide guidance to the check-in volunteers on how to proceed with that person's check-in.
The extension also populates some data fields in Neon to help track when people have checked in and how many badge re-prints someone has.
