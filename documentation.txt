Troubleshooting Badge Increment Process:

function incrementBadge, which is called immediately after sending the file to the printer,
is located in js/attendeeContact.js, currently starting at line 100

This function references custom fields in the attendee data form, which are hardcoded.
If Neon changes the order of these fields, the indexes in the function will need to be updated.
Currently, the # of active badges field is 7, Time and Date fields are 9-16.
I refactored the field definitions to be in a single place for easier maintenance.  Current location is lines 101-103.

Other fields are references as they are used throughout the code, search for "attendee.customDataList" to find references.
